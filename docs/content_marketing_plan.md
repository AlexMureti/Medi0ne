# Medione Global Content Marketing Strategy: Health Education, Medical Advice, Pharmacy Services, and Positioning Nancy Kimathi as Leading Medical Consultant

## Executive Summary & Objectives

Medione’s mission is to become a trusted, go-to resource for evidence-based health education and community pharmacy services in Nanyuki, Kenya, with a growing global footprint. This strategy sets out a regulatory-compliant, SEO-led content marketing program designed to elevate Medione’s digital presence, serve patients and caregivers with accessible and inclusive content, and position Nancy Kimathi—a licensed pharmaceutical technologist (Pharmacy and Poisons Board of Kenya registration PPB2231, status active through December 31, 2025)—as a credible and compassionate medical consultant and educator.[^2] It focuses on four pillars: health education, medical advice (non-diagnostic, general guidance), pharmacy services, and thought leadership, supported by an editorial foundation of compliance, transparency, and patient-centricity.[^1][^3][^4]

Business objectives over 6–12 months include:

- Organic audience growth: drive qualified traffic from Kenya and East Africa, expanding to a global English-speaking audience seeking dependable pharmacy and health education content.
- Authority building: establish Nancy Kimathi as a leading voice in patient-first pharmacy practice, medication adherence, and community health.
- Patient acquisition and engagement: convert content consumption to service inquiries and bookings (prescription handling, consultations, laboratory, vaccination, health checkups, deliveries, appointment scheduling), especially via WhatsApp and Medione’s website.[^2]
- Trust and brand equity: strengthen Medione’s reputation for accuracy, safety, and ethical conduct—reinforced by robust compliance and community impact.

Measurable outcomes:

- Awareness: increase non-branded search visibility for high-intent health education topics and pharmacy service queries.
- Engagement: grow session duration, return visits, video watch time, and resource downloads.
- Conversion: channel traffic to WhatsApp, appointment booking, and consultation requests.
- Brand sentiment: improve trust signals through reviews, testimonials, and public health advocacy.

Information gaps that will be addressed early include: the official website URL and analytics access, a confirmed public relationship between Nancy Kimathi and Medione, details of video production resources, legal counsel and PPB content guidance, baseline analytics, stakeholder sign-off workflows, and the country prioritization list for content localization (see Compliance and Risk Management; Governance). While today’s public records show Nancy’s affiliation as a pharmaceutical technologist at Goodlife Pharmacy Ltd and do not confirm an ownership role at Medione, this plan carefully avoids any unverified assertions and includes a transparent approval pathway to ensure all claims are properly substantiated.[^2]

This strategy integrates content, distribution, SEO, community programs, governance, and measurement into a coherent, repeatable operating model, designed for agility and continuous improvement in line with pharma content best practices.[^1][^3][^4]

## Brand & Expert Positioning

Medione is anchored by real services available at its Peak Place Mall location (Nanyuki), including prescriptions, medication consultations, laboratory services, vaccinations, health checkups (blood pressure and glucose), deliveries, appointment booking, and family/children’s health services. These assets offer an authentic foundation for educational content, decision-support tools, and community programming.[^2] Positioning emphasizes patient-first clarity, local accessibility, and global standards of evidence and ethics.

Nancy Kimathi’s qualifications—registration number PPB2231, valid active status through December 31, 2025, and a background in pharmaceutical practice—establish credibility in medication safety, therapy adherence, and practical wellness education. Her thought leadership should center on translating complex science into everyday guidance, and advocating for accessible, compassionate care that respects local context and constraints.[^1][^2]

To maintain trust and compliance, Medione will ensure every public-facing piece of content (blogs, videos, social posts) is reviewed and approved by qualified medical and compliance reviewers before publication. Privacy safeguards will be embedded into the production workflow to protect patients and community members. Nancy’s public presence will consistently disclose her credentials and role, using plain language and inclusive design to improve comprehension across literacy levels, and supporting multilingual accessibility where needed.[^1][^3][^4]

To illustrate the core asset underpinning this strategy, the following snapshot clarifies Medione’s services and contact details:

### Nancy Kimathi Credentials & Public Profile

Nancy’s professional profile is publicly established through Pharmacy and Poisons Board (PPB) records (registration PPB2231; active status through December 31, 2025). Her public-facing bio should emphasize:

- Educational translator: demystifying medication mechanisms, side effects, and interactions using patient-friendly explanations, visual aids, and Q&A formats.
- Community health advocate: promoting adherence, preventive care, vaccination confidence, and chronic disease self-management.
- Ethics and transparency: maintaining a patient-first stance, upholding privacy, and providing balanced information with clear disclaimers.

Distribution plan:

- Website author page with credentials, scope of practice, and compliance disclosures.
- LinkedIn thought leadership series (insights on medication adherence, vaccine literacy, and local care navigation), complemented by Instagram Reels and Facebook Live Q&A.
- Social media profiles and video descriptions include disclaimers: content is educational and not a substitute for personalized medical advice; encourage consultation via Medione’s contact channels for individual cases.[^2]

## Audience & Journey Mapping

The program will serve four priority audiences: patients and caregivers; healthcare professionals (HCPs); women (including maternal and child health seekers); and local community members in Nanyuki and surrounding areas. For each audience, content will be designed to meet core needs—clear guidance, safety updates, accessible resources, and practical service navigation—while guiding them along three content journey stages: awareness, consideration, and decision.[^1][^3][^4]

Accessibility and inclusivity principles include plain language, alt text, captions, culturally competent imagery and examples, and attention to health literacy and digital divides. Given the widespread use of smartphones and social platforms, content will be mobile-first, with video summaries for complex topics and infographics for decision aids.[^4]

To illustrate alignment of audiences, needs, formats, and conversion pathways, Table 2 maps the audience-journey-content matrix.

Table 2: Audience–Journey–Content matrix

| Audience             | Stage          | Core Needs                                      | Primary Content Formats                     | Channels                    | CTAs                                           |

This matrix anchors the editorial plan and informs cross-channel consistency, ensuring each audience receives the right format at the right moment, with clear pathways to service engagement.[^1][^3][^4]

## Content Pillars & Editorial Strategy

Four core pillars organize the editorial effort:

1. Health Education: Condition explainers, medication guides, preventive care, and vaccination literacy presented in plain language with visual reinforcement.[^1][^3]
2. Medical Advice (Non-Diagnostic): Practical medication safety tips, adherence strategies, and wellness guidance that avoid individual diagnosis and direct readers to consult a pharmacist or clinician for personalized care.[^3][^4]
3. Pharmacy Services: Clear explanations of prescriptions, consultations, laboratory testing, vaccinations, health checkups, delivery options, appointment booking, and family/children’s services, reinforced by step-by-step logistics and FAQs.[^2]
4. Thought Leadership (Nancy Kimathi): Evidence-based commentary, myth-busting, professional insights, and community advocacy that build trust and authority.[^1]

Cross-cutting practices:

- Compliance: all content undergoes medical/legal review; disclaimers clarify scope; patient privacy is protected and consent obtained where needed.[^1][^3][^4]
- Transparency: disclosures of credentials, potential biases, and sources; avoidance of promotional claims that cannot be substantiated.[^1]
- Plain language and accessibility: straightforward writing, alt text, captions, readable design, and multilingual efforts where feasible.[^4]
- Localization: respect for Kenyan/East African health practices, terminology, and context, with plans for country prioritization based on audience demand and legal review.

To operationalize the pillars, Table 3 provides an editorial matrix.

Table 3: Editorial pillars, subtopics, content types, and primary channels

| Pillar                | Subtopics                                              | Content Types                            | Primary Channels          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Health Education      | Condition explainers; medication safety; vaccines       | Blogs; infographics; 60–90s videos       | Website; Instagram; Facebook |
| Medical Advice        | Adherence tips; interactions; side effect management   | Tips lists; Q&A reels; FAQs              | Website; YouTube; Instagram |
| Pharmacy Services     | Prescriptions; lab; vaccinations; checkups; delivery   | Service explainers; how-to videos; FAQs  | Website; WhatsApp; Google Profile |
| Thought Leadership    | Myth-busting; ethics; community advocacy               | LinkedIn articles; panels; webinars      | LinkedIn; Website; YouTube  |

This matrix drives production and scheduling, balancing depth with accessibility, and aligning assets to channels where they will be most discoverable and effective.[^1][^3]

### Pillar 1: Health Education

Health education content will demystify common conditions, medications, and preventive measures. Posts will use everyday language, reinforced with infographics and short videos that break down mechanisms and side effects. Example topics include understanding antibiotics stewardship, navigating blood pressure readings, and preparing for vaccinations. Each piece will reference reputable sources and end with a reminder to consult Medione for personalized guidance.[^1][^3]

### Pillar 2: Medical Advice (Non-Diagnostic)

Guides will focus on medication adherence, practical tips to manage side effects, and general wellness practices, with explicit disclaimers that content is educational. Call-to-actions will prompt readers to book consultations, ask questions via WhatsApp, or attend a pharmacist Q&A session for individualized advice.[^3][^4]

### Pillar 3: Pharmacy Services

Service explainers will clarify what patients can expect—how to prepare for lab tests, what vaccination schedules entail, how blood pressure or glucose screenings work, and the logistics of home delivery and appointment booking. CTAs will integrate WhatsApp and phone numbers, creating a seamless path from information to action.[^2]

### Pillar 4: Thought Leadership (Nancy Kimathi)

Nancy’s thought leadership will highlight patient-first perspectives, myth-busting around vaccines and chronic disease management, and lessons from pharmacy practice. LinkedIn articles, panel invitations, and webinars will translate clinical nuance into actionable insights for patients and peers, building recognition as a leading medical consultant.[^1]

## SEO & Organic Growth Strategy

A comprehensive keyword strategy will prioritize patients’ needs, high-intent pharmacy service queries, and evidence-based health topics. Topic clusters will revolve around medication safety, vaccinations, chronic disease management, women’s health, and common local conditions. On-page optimization will emphasize clarity and compliance, while technical SEO and local signals (Google Business Profile, citations, reviews) will be strengthened to drive in-person engagement.[^3][^5][^6]

Keyword clusters and intent mapping will connect queries to content types and CTAs. For example, “how to manage medication side effects” aligns with a tips list and invites consultation via WhatsApp; “vaccination schedule Nanyuki” aligns with service explainers and booking CTAs.

On-page SEO will include descriptive titles and meta descriptions, structured headings, internal linking to service pages, and an accessible design. Technical SEO priorities include mobile optimization, fast loading, and clean URL structures. Local SEO will focus on Google Business Profile optimization, consistent NAP (name, address, phone) data, and active review management.[^5][^6]

Link-building will prioritize backlinks from reputable healthcare sources and collaborations with local partners. Content will be repurposed into formats that naturally attract links (checklists, infographics, evidence summaries).

To demonstrate the breadth of keyword targeting, Table 4 outlines priority clusters by audience and pillar.

Table 4: Priority keyword clusters

| Cluster                         | Example Queries                                | Audience            | Pillar                 | Content Type                 | CTA                                     |

| Skin care                       | “basic skincare routine and product guidance” | Patients/Caregivers | Pharmacy Services      | Infographic; tips list       | “Book beauty consultation”               |
| HCP engagement                  | “pharmacy practice updates Kenya PPB”         | HCPs                | Thought Leadership     | LinkedIn article             | “Invite to panel/webinar”                |

These clusters will guide topic selection and on-page optimization, ensuring content aligns to search intent and conversion goals.[^3][^5][^6]

### Keyword & Topic Planning

Long-tail keywords will target patient questions in plain language (e.g., “how to take metformin safely,” “what to expect during vaccination”). Topic clusters will be developed around each pillar, with internal links to related posts and service pages to improve discoverability and reduce bounce rates.[^3]

### Local SEO & Listings

To improve local discoverability, Google Business Profile and directory listings will be fully optimized with consistent NAP data, service descriptions, photos, and regular posts. Reviews will be actively encouraged, with responses timed and tone-checked for empathy and accuracy.[^5][^6]

Table 5: Directory and citation sources to maintain

| Platform             | URL                  | Status         | Last Updated |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Google Business      | profiles.google.com  | To be claimed  | TBD          |

| Better Business Bureau| bbb.org             | To be created  | TBD          |

Consistency and ongoing updates across these listings will reinforce local SEO signals and improve trust.[^6]

## Content Calendar & Formats

Cadence balances quality with resource realities: weekly blog posts, two social posts per platform per week, one video per month, and one webinar per quarter. A 12-month calendar will cover seasonal health themes (e.g., allergy season, cold/flu, maternal health cycles), local events, and public health priorities. Blog content will follow SEO best practices; videos will include captions and clear visuals; webinars will be repurposed into clips and summaries.[^3][^6]

To operationalize scheduling, Table 6 outlines the monthly calendar structure.

Short-form explainers (30–90 seconds) will present single ideas clearly: how medications work, what to expect from vaccinations, and medication storage and adherence tips. Longer educational sessions (10–20 minutes) will cover chronic disease management basics and pharmacy service walk-throughs, all with captions and simple visuals to enhance accessibility.[^3][^4] Webinars will be conducted quarterly and repurposed into clips, blog summaries, and social snippets for ongoing distribution.

Table 7 provides a concept tracker to govern production.

These concepts prioritize clarity, compliance, and conversion, ensuring each video offers both educational value and a next step.[^3][^4]

## Social Media Strategy

Platform roles will be differentiated. LinkedIn will anchor Nancy’s thought leadership and HCP engagement; Instagram will deliver quick tips, myth-busting, and behind-the-scenes empathy; Facebook will prioritize community updates, events, and longer educational posts that facilitate sharing and local reach. WhatsApp will function as a service channel for booking, delivery inquiries, and consultation follow-ups.[^3][^6]

Community management will focus on education and moderation, with careful handling of misinformation and privacy considerations. Comment responses will invite consultations without offering individual medical advice; sensitive discussions will be redirected to private channels or in-person visits. Disclaimers will be present in profiles and video descriptions to set expectations and protect patient privacy.[^4]

Table 8 provides a channel plan.

Table 8: Channel plan

| Platform  | Content Types                              | Post Frequency | Primary KPIs                        | Representative Post Ideas                                  |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| LinkedIn  | Thought leadership; industry insights       | 2–3/week       | Engagement; shares; profile views   | “Myth vs. Fact: Vaccines”; “Lessons from Adherence”       |
| Instagram | Tips; myth-busting; Reels; behind-the-scenes| 3–4/week       | Views; saves; profile visits        | “Medication Storage Tips”; “BP Myths Busted”              |
| Facebook  | Community updates; events; longer education | 3–4/week       | Reach; comments; referrals          | “Vaccination Schedule Post”; “Lab Test Prep Checklist”    |
| WhatsApp  | Service communication; booking              | As needed      | Inquiries; bookings; response time  | “Book vaccination”; “Delivery options”                    |
| YouTube   | Educational videos; webinar replays         | 1/month        | Watch time; subscribers             | “Medication Side Effects 101”; “How to Book via WhatsApp” |

Consistent, purposeful posting will build visibility, trust, and conversion across the funnel.[^3][^6]

## Community Engagement Programs

Community engagement programs will bring content to life through real-world touchpoints: free health screenings, vaccination drives, and workshops hosted in partnership with local healthcare providers and businesses. Peer support groups and patient communities will be nurtured with evidence-based resources and moderated discussions. Public health initiatives will focus on literacy, advocacy, and accessibility, especially for underserved populations.[^4][^6]

Table 9 outlines the quarterly community plan.

Table 9: Quarterly community engagement plan

| Quarter | Program                               | Target Audience        | Lead Champion     | Content Outputs                          | KPI Targets                         |
|---------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Q1      | BP/Glucose Screening Day               | Local adults           | Nancy Kimathi     | Event posts; explainer blog; video        | 100 attendees; 20 bookings          |
| Q2      | Maternal & Child Health Workshop       | Women & caregivers     | Nancy Kimathi     | Webinar; Instagram Q&A; handouts          | 150 registrants; 30 consultations   |

| Q4      | Chronic Disease Self-Management Series | Patients/Caregivers    | Nancy Kimathi     | 3-session webinar; clips; checklists      | 180 registrants; 40 service inquiries|

Programs will be evaluated on attendance, bookings, and satisfaction scores, feeding insights back into content refinement.[^4][^6]

## Compliance & Risk Management

Compliance is foundational. Every content asset will be reviewed by medical and legal reviewers prior to publication. Disclaimers will clarify educational scope and avoid diagnosis; privacy standards will follow HIPAA- and GDPR-aligned principles where applicable, including consent and anonymization for patient stories and testimonials.[^1][^9][^10] Evidence citations will be used to support claims, and regulated content rules will be observed for pharma communications.

Misinformation management will rely on moderation policies and corrective responses that steer conversations toward evidence-based resources and Medione’s services. A content audit cadence will be established to review and update existing materials, remove outdated content, and ensure continued accuracy and compliance.[^3][^4]

Table 10 codifies the review workflow.

Table 10: Content review workflow

| Step             | Role                  | SLA         | Required Fields/Artifacts                          |
|------------------|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Draft            | Writer/Editor         | 3–5 days    | Topic brief; outline; key sources                  |
| Medical Review   | Pharmacist/Clinician  | 2–3 days    | Accuracy check; clinical alignment                 |
| Legal Review     | Legal/Compliance      | 2–3 days    | Disclaimers; privacy; regulatory alignment         |
| Final Approval   | Content Lead          | 1 day       | Tone; accessibility; consistency across channels   |
| Publish          | Digital Lead          | Same day    | Metadata; alt text; captions; tracking setup       |
| Audit            | Compliance Team       | Quarterly   | Review dated content; updates; archival decisions  |

Workflow discipline will safeguard patient trust and Medione’s reputation while enabling agile content production.[^1][^3][^9][^10]

## Governance & Operating Model

Roles and responsibilities will be clearly defined across content, medical review, legal/compliance, design, video, and social/community management. An editorial board, including Nancy Kimathi and compliance representation, will set priorities, review plans, and approve content. Tools will include project management systems, compliance tracking, analytics platforms, and social listening to monitor sentiment and emerging topics.[^1][^4]

Table 11 clarifies responsibilities through a RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix.

Clear accountability will ensure quality, compliance, and timeliness, while enabling scalable production.[^1][^4]

## Measurement, KPIs & Optimization

Success will be defined by improvements in awareness, engagement, conversion, and brand sentiment. A measurement framework will track KPIs across channels and tie outcomes to content adjustments. Reporting will occur monthly, with quarterly strategy reviews that incorporate audience feedback, performance data, and compliance insights.[^3][^1]

Table 12 defines the KPI dashboard.

Optimization will rely on structured testing—headlines, visuals, CTAs—and content refresh cycles informed by performance and audience feedback.[^3][^1]
